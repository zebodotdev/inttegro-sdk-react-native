# Inttegro React Native

[API reference](https://react-native.inttegro.dev/v0.2.0/) ·
[Studio guide](https://studio.inttegro.com/sdks/react-native)

Typed React Native facade for Inttegro's native payment sheet. This is an
implementation spike and is not ready to publish or use with live payments.
The current collection surface supports mobile money; card, Apple Pay, and
Google Pay are not exposed.

```ts
import {
  addPaymentSheetEventListener,
  initializePaymentSheet,
  presentPaymentSheet,
} from '@inttegro/react-native';

// Your backend must create and finalize the Order before this handoff.
const { orderId } = await merchantBackend.createCheckoutOrder(cart);

const lifecycleSubscription = addPaymentSheetEventListener((event) => {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'presented':
      onPaymentFlowStarted();
      break;
    case 'paymentAttemptStarted':
      onPaymentAttemptStarted();
      break;
    case 'paymentAttemptFailed':
      // Recoverable: the customer can retry without leaving the native sheet.
      onPaymentAttemptFailed({ category: event.errorType });
      break;
  }
});

await initializePaymentSheet({
  orderId,
  returnURL: 'merchant-app://inttegro-return',
  telemetry: activeTraceContext, // Optional { traceparent, tracestate }.
});

try {
  const result = await presentPaymentSheet();

  switch (result.status) {
    case 'completed':
      onPaymentCompleted({ paymentId: result.paymentId });
      await merchantBackend.verifyOrderPayment(orderId);
      break;
    case 'canceled':
      onPaymentCanceled();
      break;
    case 'failed':
      onPaymentSheetFailed(result.error);
      break;
  }
} finally {
  lifecycleSubscription.remove();
}
```

Finalizing an Order seals its amount and activates checkout; it does not mean
the payment has completed. Treat the immediate `completed` result as client UI
state. Verify the owner-scoped Order from your backend before fulfillment.

The TurboModule exchanges versioned JSON with the native iOS and Android
artifacts. The native implementations own presentation, accessibility,
authentication, payment collection, and lifecycle state; JavaScript only
validates the public input and decodes the result.

`addPaymentSheetEventListener` receives typed application-facing lifecycle
events. A failed attempt is recoverable and does not resolve the presentation;
the terminal `PaymentSheetResult` drives completion, cancellation, and
sheet-failure behavior.

Use `addPaymentSheetTelemetryListener` separately for ordered Checkout network
diagnostics. Inttegro does not install or own an exporter: the host decides
whether to translate them into spans, logs, or other signals. Events contain
bounded status and correlation metadata, never Order or Payment IDs, customer
or payer data, payment-method details, request or response bodies, redirect
URLs, or raw error messages. `flowId` and `requestId` should not be used as
metric labels. Subscribe before presenting the sheet so the first event is not
missed.

The package includes a Codegen-compatible TurboModule that delegates to the
same native `Inttegro` artifacts used by the Flutter SDK. CocoaPods links the
iOS artifact through `InttegroReactNative.podspec`, while Gradle resolves
`com.inttegro:inttegro-android:0.1.0`.

## Requirements

- React Native 0.82 or later with the New Architecture enabled
- iOS 16 or later
- Android API 26 or later

Install the package and rebuild the native application so Codegen and native
autolinking can run. Expo applications need a development build; Expo Go cannot
load this native module. If the app has not been rebuilt, calling the facade
produces a linking error without preventing the host app from starting.
