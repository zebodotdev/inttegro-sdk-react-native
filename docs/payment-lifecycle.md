# Handle the payment lifecycle

Use lifecycle events for host coordination, terminal results for presentation
behavior, and the backend Order for fulfillment authority.

## Subscribe before presentation

```ts
import { addPaymentSheetEventListener } from '@inttegro/react-native/events';
import { presentPaymentSheet } from '@inttegro/react-native/payment-sheet';

const subscription = addPaymentSheetEventListener((event) => {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'presented':
      checkoutAnalytics.started();
      break;
    case 'paymentAttemptFailed':
      checkoutAnalytics.retryAvailable({ category: event.errorType });
      break;
    case 'authorizationRequired':
      showReturnToPaymentHint();
      break;
  }
});

try {
  await presentPaymentSheet();
} finally {
  subscription.remove();
}
```

Subscribe before presentation so the first event is not missed. Sequence values
increase within a flow and preserve ordering when the host batches analytics
work.

## Separate recoverable and terminal state

Checkout retrieval and payment-attempt failures can be recoverable. The native
sheet displays safe guidance and gives the payer another attempt without
resolving `presentPaymentSheet`.

Confirmation-code entry, provider redirects, device authorization, and Checkout
status polling are also native intermediate states. Terminal results are limited
to completion, customer cancellation, and an unrecoverable SDK failure.

## Reconcile on the backend

Send the Order ID to the merchant backend after client completion. Retrieve the
owner-scoped Order with server credentials, verify the expected amount and
successful payment state, and make fulfillment idempotent. Webhooks may update
the same backend state for delayed methods; React Native should render that
server-owned result instead of resolving competing client and webhook timelines.
