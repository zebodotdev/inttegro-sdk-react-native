# Get started with Checkout

Create and finalize an Order on your backend, hand its public ID to React
Native, and present Inttegro's native payment sheet.

## Choose an entry point

Use responsibility-based imports for new integrations:

```ts
import {
  initializePaymentSheet,
  presentPaymentSheet,
} from '@inttegro/react-native/payment-sheet';
import type { PaymentSheetConfiguration } from '@inttegro/react-native/types';
```

The root `@inttegro/react-native` import remains supported. Focused entry points
organize the generated reference and application imports; they delegate to the
same native module and do not create competing payment implementations.

## Create configuration

Your backend owns merchant authentication and Order creation. The application
supplies only the public Order ID and client-owned presentation options.
Merchant identity, amount, currency, line items, saved methods, and shipping
details come from Checkout.

```ts
const configuration: PaymentSheetConfiguration = {
  orderId: checkout.orderId,
  returnURL: 'merchant-app://inttegro-return',
  appearance: { primaryColor: '#0C4A3E' },
  features: {
    showLineItems: true,
    showInvoiceDownload: true,
    showReceiptDownload: true,
  },
};

await initializePaymentSheet(configuration);
```

Initialization validates the bridge payload without retrieving Checkout or
starting payment. Call it again when the Order ID or presentation options
change. Never place an Inttegro merchant API key in a mobile application.

Enabling `showLineItems` offers an Order summary without opening it for the
payer. If they choose to view the items, the native sheet expands to its
full-height detent as the summary is revealed.

## Present and interpret the result

```ts
const result = await presentPaymentSheet();

switch (result.status) {
  case 'completed':
    await merchantBackend.verifyAndFulfillOrder(checkout.orderId);
    break;
  case 'canceled':
    restoreCheckoutControls();
    break;
  case 'failed':
    recordTerminalFailure(result.error.code);
    showPaymentUnavailable();
    break;
}
```

Recoverable collection failures remain inside the native sheet and do not
resolve the promise. Even a completed result is client experience state: the
merchant backend must retrieve the owner-scoped Order and verify successful
payment before fulfillment.

## Rebuild the native application

The package contains native iOS and Android modules. Rebuild after installation
so React Native Codegen and autolinking can run. Expo applications need a
development build; Expo Go cannot load the custom native module.
